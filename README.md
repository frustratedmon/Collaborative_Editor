# Description
This collaborative webpage is a simple real-time editor where multiple users can simultaneously view and edit text. It uses WebSockets to enable instant two-way communication between the client and server, ensuring that changes made by one user are instantly broadcast to others. The frontend is built with React, featuring a clean and responsive design styled with CSS. It includes a centered layout with a large, user-friendly text area for editing. The backend handles WebSocket connections, synchronizing updates across all connected clients. This project demonstrates a functional and interactive collaborative editing experience, making it ideal for shared document editing or live note-taking scenarios.
